                  <div align=j ustify>
                      <p>I am a research assistant and master's student at <a href="https://www.uao.edu.co/">Universidad Autonoma de Occidente (UAO)</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=x3M1JlAAAAAJ&hl=en"> Victor Romero Cano</a>  with a focus on machine perception, deep learning, reinforcement learning and robotics. During my master's studies I have been working on sensor data fusion (Camera and LiDAR) for improved object recognition in the context of environment perception from mobile platforms.</p>

                     <p>Prior to that, I had a great fortune working with <a href="https://scholar.google.es/citations?hl=es&user=8MahKi0AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate"> Ricardo Moreno Chuquen</a> on problems of optimization and flexibility of modern power systems.

                      I completed my undergraduate degree at the UAO where I studied Mechatronics Engineering. During my undergraduate study, I worked with Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7PIjh_MAAAAJ&hl=en">Jesus  Alfonso Lopez</a> as an undergraduate researcher in the Artificial Intelligence team.
                     
                    </p>
                    <p> My core area of research interest is reinforcement learning with the goal of building and understanding sequential decision-making agents that learn as efficiently and as remarkably as people do.

To this end, while the successes of reinforcement learning in the single-task setting are incredibly exciting, I am most drawn to problems that stand in the way of efficient multi-task and lifelong reinforcement learning. Such problems include (but are by no means limited to) efficient exploration, hierarchical reinforcement learning, and transfer learning. I believe that a key ingredient lying at the heart of overcoming these challenges is abstraction whereby an agent's ability to acquire and maintain representations of latent task and environment structure is crucial to robust decision making

                      My research interests are concentrated at the intersection of robotics and artificial intelligence.

                    I am also try to dabble in skill learning, lifelong learning, and deep learning optimization.
